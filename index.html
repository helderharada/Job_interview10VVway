Hello, welcome to my portfolio. I'm Helder de Oliveira Harada, I've been working in the production line area for a long time and I have a lot of experience
in this area. I like learning new things and this area gives me that. With more than 10 years working on production lines, I am faced with new learning challenges:
being fluent in English and at the same time applying this in my area with a focus on working and living in Canada. My main focus is to practice the profession well
in Canada, following each learning procedure, coexistence, doing what the company offers us and thus achieving the company's and my objectives, with gains for both 
parties. I had contact with another culture when I worked outside Brazil, in Japan, and with people from cultures other than the Japanese. This happened in Japan, so
I had to adapt to situations that made me grow up having challenges and solving them. My skills range from automobile assembly, presses, electronic components and 
currently machining. Where I want to improve more in this area, such as programming, types of machines and much more. All of these approaches and experiences are 
deeply linked to safety, without which the work would be incomplete or poorly executed, with serious dangers for me and my co-workers. I am a person with a sense of 
responsibility linked to ethics, morals and rules within a company or institution. With empathy and respect for everyone who works with me. I have always believed that
order and laws in society can help us inside and outside of work, and if everyone does their part, we will have a society with quality of life. And in any culture, 
respect and education are fundamental. My current dream is to continue my professional career at the company JD Irving, which we see through many examples that have 
already contributed a lot to Canadian society, and to hire Brazilians to have the pleasure of being part of a society that has excellence in all areas. I look forward
to passing on everything I know to this incredible society, learning more and contributing to the growth and success of the institution and Canada. My portfolio is at
your disposal from here so you can see in more detail my professional trajectory, my skills and my values and beliefs. I am available to talk about opportunities, how 
to contribute and add value to the large conglomerate of companies that is JD Irving.
